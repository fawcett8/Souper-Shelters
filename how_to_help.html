		     <h1>Everyday help</h1>
		      <ul class="content_lists">
		  		<li><h4 class=everydayhelp_headings>Smile!</h4> 
		  			People become homeless for all sorts of reasons, among them abuse, redundancy and mental illness. Never stereotype regarding people’s situation, this could just as soon be your neighbour. Be compassionate and always smile or say something kind.</li>
				<li><h4 class=everydayhelp_headings>Buy the Big Issue</h4>	
					This fantastic organisation gives homeless people the opportunity to help themselves, acting as vendors, writers and designers for this weekly magazine. Priced at £2.50, 50% of the cover value goes straight to the vendor, and gives you the opportunity to learn more about societal issues from an unfamiliar perspective.</li>
				<li><h4 class=everydayhelp_headings>Give food or a hot drink</h4> 
					If you don’t feel comfortable handing over change - or have switched largely to contactless - a helpful alternative is food donations! If you’re making lunch, why not make an extra helping? Or grab a spare sandwich when you nip to the supermarket at lunch. As the colder weather sets in a hot drink can lift spirits and shows you care about those taking the brunt of harsher conditions.</li>
				<li><h4 class=everydayhelp_headings>Donate Recyclables</h4>
					Replacing a coat or scarf this winter? In wet or cold weather, a quality coat or rain jacket could help make the everyday challenges of sleeping rough more manageable for someone, so don’t throw out anything without considering its re-use first.</li>

		  	 <h1>Volunteer</h1>
		  	 <p>
		  		You can volunteer in all sorts of interesting and niche ways to help the homeless. Perhaps the most well-kown ways to volunteer your time are in a soup kitchen, shelter or charity shop. In a shelter you could use your skills, passions and hobbies to support and teach others. From arts and craft workshops to yoga, football, book clubs and ESOL lessons a lot of shelters appreciate those who can bring diversity and fun to their sessions. For those still studying, one way to get administrative experience for the CV is to volunteer in a charity's office, aiding with time-consuming but essential tasks like data entry and tax relief.
